## Project Description
This project is an implementation of the classic game Hangman. In this version, the computer selects a word at random from a predefined list of fruits, and the user attempts to guess it one letter at a time. This project serves not only as a fun and interactive game but also as an opportunity to learn and implement basic programming concepts in Python, including lists, user input handling, conditional statements, and the use of the `random` module.
